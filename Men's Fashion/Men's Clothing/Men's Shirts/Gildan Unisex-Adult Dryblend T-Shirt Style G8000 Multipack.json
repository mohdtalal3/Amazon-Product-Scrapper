I based my research and purchase on the Gildan brand sweatshirts which I think are decent quality.\nThese t-shirts are very thin, sleeves are a couple of inches too short and, the tail is easily 5 inches too long.\nI guess I should have expected this considering the cost.\nGuess I won't be buying Gildan t-shirts anymore.\nJust wondering-why is it that no manufacturer seems to be able to produce any thing more than a mediocre product anymore??\nSolution could be-raise your price slightly and actually use the extra revenue to make a decent product!!!"
